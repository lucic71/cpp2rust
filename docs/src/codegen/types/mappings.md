# Type Mappings

The table gives the spelling of each C++ type in both models, before any
refcount boxing. `T` stands for the translated inner type.

Other built-ins (`wchar_t`, `long double`, `char16_t`) are omitted.

## User-defined types as rules

When a record or enum declaration is converted,
`Mapper::AddRuleForUserDefinedType` registers it in the mapper's type table: the
C++ name maps to the Rust name, and its pointer form maps to `*mut Name` or
`Ptr<Name>` (`*mut dyn Name` or `PtrDyn<dyn Name>` for abstract classes); nested
records are registered too. This is what makes library types instantiated with
user types translatable: `Mapper::Map` matches `std::vector<Item>` against the
rule for `std::vector<T1>` and then has to map `T1 = Item` through the same
table, which would fail if `Item` were not in it.

## Scalars

`char` is `libc::c_char` in the unsafe model, whose signedness follows the
platform like C's, and `u8` in the refcount model, because C strings are byte
vectors there (see [C Strings](../../runtime/cstr.md)). Since most C
implementations have signed `char`, the refcount model is set to switch to `i8`
([#246](https://github.com/Cpp2Rust/cpp2rust/issues/246)).

## Arrays

In the refcount model a constant array becomes `Box<[T]>`, dropping the length.
`Ptr<T>` carries only the element type, not `N`, so a `[T; N]` could not be
pointed to without a `Ptr` per length; `Box<[T]>` gives arrays of every length,
and heap arrays, the same shape. `[T; N]` survives only inside `sizeof`, which
becomes `::std::mem::size_of::<[T; N]>()`.

Array parameters decay to pointers as in C.

## Typedefs and qualifiers

Typedef names are looked up as type rules before being desugared, which is how
`size_t` maps to `usize` instead of the underlying `unsigned long`.

Constness is dropped: in the unsafe model it survives only as `*const` on
pointers and as a missing `mut` on bindings, and in the refcount model it has no
representation.

The [Pointers and References](../pointers.md) page covers how values of pointer
types are read and written.
